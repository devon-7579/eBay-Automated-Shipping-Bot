## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger** — The automation starts from the Appilot dashboard when new orders appear in the eBay account. The user configures shipping preferences such as carriers and packaging.  
2. **Core Logic** — The system fetches pending orders using eBay’s API or app interface, validates data, and interacts with carrier APIs to generate shipping labels.  
3. **Output or Action** — Labels are stored locally or sent via email, and tracking numbers are pushed to eBay automatically.  
4. **Other Functionalities** — Includes retry logic, error handling, and parallel device control to ensure consistent and reliable operation across large order volumes.
